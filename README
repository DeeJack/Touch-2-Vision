# Touch 2 Vision

The project consists of a few steps:

- [X] Isolate the hand/sensor in the frame
- [X] Use inpainting to remove it from the video
- [ ] Use a monocular depth algorithm to estimate the depth of the object being pressed by the sensor
- [ ] Generate the object profile from the depth information

After doing that:

- [ ] From the object profile, generate the 3D object using optical flow
